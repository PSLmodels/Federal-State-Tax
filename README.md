# Federal-State Tax Project

The Federal-State Tax Project develops open source tools for analyzing the impact of federal tax reforms by state. These impacts vary widely across states due to differences in tax-relevant factors such as the income distribution; relative importance of wage, business, and retirement income; and family size and structure. Understanding the state specific impact of a reform is important to state and federal policymakers among others.

## Project Goals
- Construct state weights for the Tax-Calculator-ready Public Use File (puf.csv), such that: 
    - Weighted summaries by state are consistent with published or forecasted summary data for the state, and; 
    - State weights on each record sum to the record's national weight, ensuring that the state result equals the national result. 
- Produce 50-state distributional tables, rankings, and other useful results for important policy  proposals and legislation. 

## Tools under development
- Weighting repo: TK
- puf_analysis repo: TK

## Other essential tools this project uses
- Tax-Calculator - We use the Tax-Calculator microsimulation model for estimating federal individual income and payroll tax liabilities under baseline and reform policy scenarios.
- Tax Data - We use TaxData to construct an initial set of national microdata for use with Tax-Calculator, which we then modify and augment.

## Other resources this project offers
- [Report](https://www.aei.org/research-products/report/repealing-the-salt-cap-state-by-state-impact/) using the tools developed by the project to estimate the impact of repealing the TCJA's SALT cap in 2021 on the 50 states.
